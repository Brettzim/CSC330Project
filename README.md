# CSC330Project
Pre-Alpha
For this project, I plan on making a game where the user controls a spaceship. The challenge is to dodge asteroids flying accross the screen. The goal is to dodge as many as possible for a score.
The analog input device I will use is a light dependent resistor to control the sprite.
